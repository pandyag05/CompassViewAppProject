# CompassViewAppProject
This app shows us what direction and degree you are standing or moving around.
I have cresated this app myself. This app lets person know which way you are standing. Also, this app lets driver know which way you are driving. Generally, the compass indicates 8 poles of direction with degrees. Howerver, this app is different from other compass. This app indicates 16 poles of direction with degrees. It shows us one image to see what exact degree you are standing or moving around. When you are rotating your phone, this app shows you which poles and degrees you are.
